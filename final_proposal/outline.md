The outline.

* Better understanding of cellular reprogramming brings many opportunities and benefits.

* Describe uses for reprogrammed tissues. Describes limitations and challenges in field of reprogramming.

* Recent results show that the results of reprogramming do not completely match the target cell type, so there is more to be desired. CellNet as a way to quantify differences and predict important factors. GRNs as current gold standard for cell state.

* Previously ectopic expression of transcription factors and knockdowns were the methods of choice for steering cell reprogramming. I think some chemical methods / physical methods have been employed as well.

* Now we have dCas9 which can be fused to various domains to allow for multiplex editing, both upregulation of transcription factors, as well as repression of certain regions.

* Outline of the three aims, specifically how we add complexity to the toolkit.

Aim 1: Show that we can "rediscover" Yamanaka factors using our new strategy, activation only.

* Describe dCas9 fusion, and alternates. We can either do promoter activation, or we can bring in chromatin remodelers.

* Describe CombiGEM strategy (Cheng, Lu).

* characterize sgRNA activity OR test multiple sgRNAs. The sgRNAs can fit into the combinatorial strategy.

* Perform flow cytometry after some number of days post infection to look for expression of particular markers. Alternatively can use strategy used by Yamanaka to confer resistance to some sort of toxin.

* Controls:
    - Negative: Experiment where we leave out Yamanaka factors.
    - Positive: Experiment where we only use Yamanaka factors.

* Risks:
    - Can each of these transcription factors really be sufficiently activated?
    - How do calibrate lentivirus infection rates to only get one or a few infections.

Aim 2: Show that we can simultaneously do upregulation and downregulation. I think there is an example in hepatocytes where we want to do both.

* Controls:
    - Negative: Experiment where we leave out relevant factors.
    - Positive: Experiment where we only use the relevant factors.

* Why is liver tissue interesting? Therapeutically interesting.

* If we can achieve Aim 1, then we take on more difficult task of reprogramming something else.

* Risks:
    - How orthogonal is orthogonal?

Aim 3: Use pooled approach and greater number of candidate targets, as well as iteration, to identify new path for differentiation.

Apply system to something new, perhaps in vivo test? i.e. can we find product that is better than others? Perhaps reconstituting hepatocytes?

* Try using greater set of combinations.

Further work:

In addition to activation and repression, we also want to think about chromatin state modifiers. This is something that we've ignored a little bit in this discussion here.
