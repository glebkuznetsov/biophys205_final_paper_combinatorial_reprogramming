# Biophysics 205 Final Project Ideas

## Methods

Single cell methods (RNA-Seq / DNA-Seq / ChIP-Seq)

## Topics

Development

Differentiation

Integrating epigenomic data

BRCA saturation mutagenesis-type experiment

## Ideas

### Collaborative Filtering Biology

Sampling mutagenesis space. Statistical interpolation of results. Collaborative filtering to interpret results.

Random chromatin blah blah.

### Mutagenesis

Can use new Shendure method or Lu method (in vivo MAGE) to try to saturate some space of changes. What questions or assays am I interested in?

### Cell state

Can we find stable states in differentiation using dCas9 and other modulators? Tricky because we have to control environment.

### Differentiation

* Recent studies have shown that reprogrammed cells are still not fully reprogrammed due to remaining signatures in GRNs

* Assuming we trust GRNs as measure of cell state

* In order to get closer to final cell state, we can perturb various aspects.

* Profile multiple dimensions of cells, including methylation state,

* Perturb different parts through orthogonal activation

* Single cell RNA-seq to identify cells closest to target GRN, includes barcodes of TFs

* Include multiple targets for activation by CRISPR - this is combinatorially encoded

* Can also include one for repression
